# Laravel Inertia Vite - LIV

This is an example repository of Lavavel + Intertia + Vite, better known as LIV Stack.

Laravel is one the most popular PHP frameworks. Combine that with Intertia a fresh solution to bridge the frontend with the backend. And on top that Vite as tool for the frontend.

## What does this solve

Laravel Intertia Vite is golden combi of three powerfull solutions. Laravel is a great backend framework to build small to enterprice level applications. Intertia is a new way of bridging server with the client by providing an ellegant api and protocol to serve your data from the server to the api. And Vite is powerfull buildtool providing the next generation javascript and typescript tooling. It basically builds you app to small compatible (not IE) javscript bundles. 

In this setup I used the Vite to split each page up in separate assets for each page. That result in superfast scalable sollution on top of laravel.
